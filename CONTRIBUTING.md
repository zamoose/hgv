## Issues ##

Open a GitHub issue for anything. Don't worry if you find yourself opening something that sounds like it could be obvious. Someone else might have the same question.

## Comments ##

Comment on any GitHub issue, open or closed. The only guidelines here are to be friendly and welcoming. If you see that a question has been asked and you think you know the answer, feel free to respond. No need to wait!

## Pull Requests

Submit a pull request at any time, whether an issue has been created or not. It may be helpful to discuss your goals in an issue first, though many things can best be shown with code.

We do ask that the pull request be submitted against the current **master** branch. Every effort is made to make the pull request as stable as possible before merging it in, so we aren't too worried. A list of stable releases is maintained as we go and can be used by anyone concerned by ongoing development.

## Code Style ##

### Ansible ###

The vast majority of HGV is written in and powered by Ansible. We are developing an Ansible scripting standard.

### Bash Scripting ###

For any shell scripting that we do in Bash — see `bin/hgv-init.sh` — we try to follow the style provided in Google's [Shell Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/shell.xml).

### PHP ###

For any PHP, we try to follow the WordPress core [code standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/).
