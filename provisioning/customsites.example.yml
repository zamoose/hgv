#
# This file is an example of what the HGV provisioner will expect in order to
# set up new, custom domains.
#
# In order to have HGV parse it, a file named "customsites.yml" must be
# formatted as below and placed in [HGV install directory]/hgv_data/.
#
# Sites specified in hgv_data/customsites.yml will be provisioned automatically,
# as long as a few conventions are followed.
#
# The result of this file should be:
#
# * Additional directories in hgv_data/, e.g.
#
#   hgv_data/
#           |
#           sites/
#                |
#                laravel.hgv.dev/
#                |
#                wp-api.hgv.dev/
#                |             |
#                |             [regular WordPress install]
#                |
#                foo.hgv.dev/
#                           |
#                           [regular WordPress install]
#
# * Host names added to /etc/hosts on the HGV VM, e.g.
#   127.0.0.1 fpm.hgv.dev hhvm.hgv.dev php.hgv.dev mail.hgv.dev\
#             admin.hgv.dev nowp.hgv.dev foo.hgv.dev bar.hgv.dev\
#             baz.hgv.dev vvv.hgv.dev laravel.hgv.dev wp-api.hgv.dev
#
# * If you have the Vagrant hostsupdater plugin installed, you should have
#   those host entries added to your OS' hosts file, e.g.
#
#   192.168.150.20  hgv.dev  # VAGRANT: [long alphanumeric hash]
#   192.168.150.20  fpm.hgv.dev  # VAGRANT: [long alphanumeric hash]
#   192.168.150.20  hhvm.hgv.dev  # VAGRANT: [long alphanumeric hash]
#   192.168.150.20  php.hgv.dev  # VAGRANT: [long alphanumeric hash]
#   192.168.150.20  mail.hgv.dev  # VAGRANT: [long alphanumeric hash]
#   192.168.150.20  admin.hgv.dev  # VAGRANT: [long alphanumeric hash]
#   192.168.150.20  nowp.hgv.dev  # VAGRANT: [long alphanumeric hash]
#
# NOTE: In order to make sure everything provisions correctly, any sites
# added to the customsites/customwpsites lists *must* have a corresponding
# entry added to the customdomains list as well. You may add *more* domains
# to customdomains than you have sites, but it must have at *least* all
# of the sites' domains specified.

#
# These are the domains to be provisioned
#
customdomains:
  - nowp.hgv.dev
  - foo.hgv.dev
  - bar.hgv.dev
  - baz.hgv.dev
  - vvv.hgv.dev
  - laravel.hgv.dev
  - wp-api.hgv.dev

#
# These are non-WordPress sites HGV will provision.
# By default, they will simply have an empty docroot and
# a corresponding Nginx virtual host declaration with a basic
# PHP configuration.
#
customsites:
  - site: laravel.hgv.dev

customwpsites:
    # This should be a DNS name and have a corresponding
    # customdomains entry
  - site: wp-api.hgv.dev
    # This will be used as the default WordPress
    # site title
