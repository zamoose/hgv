# Core Ansible config hints file.
#
# Root-level array members should line up with
# Ansible host groups
#
# Ansible expects JSON output from a dynamic inventory,
# as per http://docs.ansible.com/developing_inventory.html#script-conventions
#
# Using the supplied inventory file, HGV should output JSON
# roughly similar to:
